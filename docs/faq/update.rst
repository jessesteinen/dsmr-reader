FAQ: Updating the application
=============================

The version you are running is always based on the 'latest' version of the application, called the `master` branch.
Every once in a while there may be updates. You can also easily check for updates by using the application's Status page.

.. warning::
    
    Before updating, **please make sure you have a recent backup of your database**! :doc:`More information about backups can be found here<../application>`.

You can update your application to the latest version by executing **deploy.sh**, located in the root of the project. 
Make sure to execute it while logged in as the ``dsmr`` user::

   sudo su - dsmr
   cd dsmr-reader
   ./deploy.sh
